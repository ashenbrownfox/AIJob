## The Career Fair Reality

<!-- Note: Image shows chaos of career fair -->

---

## The Problem

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 0.9em;">

**Typical Career Fair Experience:**
- ⏰ 8-16 hours across 1-2 days
- ⌛ 2+ hour lines for "big name" companies
- 😫 Exhausted recruiters, exhausted you
- 🤷 Generic conversations, no differentiation
- ❌ Misaligned skills & opportunities

**The Result:** You waste time on the wrong companies while perfect matches go unnoticed.

</div>

---

## The Solution

<img src="ai-strategy.svg" style="width: 70%; margin: 20px auto;" />

### Strategic, AI-Powered Career Fair Domination

Use AI to find perfect matches between YOUR skills and THEIR needs.

---

## Beyond Prompt Engineering

# Context Engineering

<img src="context-engineering.svg" style="width: 75%; margin: 20px auto;" />

It's not magic. It's strategic information architecture.

---

## What is Context Engineering?

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 0.85em;">

**Prompt Engineering:** Asking the right question  
**Context Engineering:** Building the right knowledge base

Think of it as:
1. 🧱 **Building** - Creating a rich context foundation
2. 🔍 **Querying** - Asking targeted questions
3. 🎯 **Refining** - Iterating for better results
4. 📊 **Analyzing** - Extracting actionable insights

**It's about feeding the AI the RIGHT information so it can give you PERFECT answers.**

### Go beyond the resume

---

## 🛠️ Workshop Activity 1
### Building Your AI Persona

**Time: 10 minutes**

1. Open ChatGPT (or your preferred AI tool)
2. Start a new chat - this will be your "Career Fair Assistant"
3. Use **Prompt #1** (on next slide)

---

## Prompt #1: Persona Builder

<div style="font-size: 0.65em;">

```markdown
I'm preparing for a career fair and need to build a comprehensive 
profile of my skills, experience, and goals. I'll provide my resume, 
but I also want to add context that isn't explicitly written.

[PASTE YOUR RESUME HERE]

Additional context:
- Courses I've excelled in: [LIST]
- Projects I'm proud of: [DESCRIBE]
- Technical skills I'm developing: [LIST]
- Soft skills I bring: [DESCRIBE]
- Career goals (6 months - 2 years): [DESCRIBE]
- Industries I'm interested in: [LIST]
- Work environment preferences: [DESCRIBE]

Please create a comprehensive persona profile that captures my 
strengths, skills, and career aspirations. Format this as a 
structured profile I can reference.
```

</div>

---

## Step 2: Analyze Companies

<img src="company-analysis.svg" style="width: 65%; margin: 10px auto; display: block;" />

### Turn company listings into strategic intelligence

---

## Where to Find Company Info

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 0.85em;">

**Your University Provides This!**

- 📋 Career Fair Partner Catalogs
- 🌐 Handshake listings
- 💼 Company profiles with descriptions
- 📝 Role descriptions & requirements

**Pro Tip:** Most universities publish a list of attending companies 1-2 weeks before the career fair. Grab it immediately!

</div>

---

## 🛠️ Workshop Activity 2
### Company Intelligence Gathering

**Time: 15 minutes**

1. Copy company descriptions from career fair catalog
2. Feed them into your AI (same chat thread)
3. Use **Prompts #2, #3, #4** for each company

---

## Prompt #2: Company Analysis

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">

```markdown
I found this company in my university's career fair catalog:

[PASTE COMPANY DESCRIPTION/LISTING]

Based on this information, please extract and organize:
1. What roles/positions are they recruiting for?
2. What specific technical skills are they seeking?
3. What soft skills or qualities do they emphasize?
4. Is this a paid opportunity? (internship/full-time)
5. Duration (if internship - 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?)
6. Location(s) of work
7. Any special requirements (GPA, graduation date, etc.)

Format this as a structured company profile.
```

</div>

---

## Prompt #3: Skills Match Analysis

<div style="font-size: 0.75em;">

```markdown
Based on my persona profile from earlier and this company profile, 
analyze:

1. Match Score (0-10): How well do my skills align?
2. Strengths: Which of my skills are most relevant?
3. Gaps: What am I missing (if anything)?
4. Bridge Strategy: How can I position my experience to fill gaps?
5. Talking Points: 3-5 specific things I should mention when 
   talking to their recruiter

Be honest about the match quality.
```

</div>

---

## Prompt #4: Build the Knowledge Table

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">

```markdown
Add this company to a comparison table with these columns:
- Company Name
- Role Type
- Match Score (0-10)
- Top 3 Relevant Skills I Have
- Compensation (Paid/Unpaid/Unknown)
- Duration
- Key Talking Points
- Priority Level (High/Medium/Low)

After analyzing multiple companies, show me the complete table 
sorted by Priority Level and Match Score.
```

</div>

---

## Step 3: Strategic Prioritization

<img src="prioritization-matrix.svg" style="width: 80%; margin: 20px auto;" />

### Focus your energy where it matters most

---

## 🛠️ Workshop Activity 3
### Creating Your Action Plan

**Time: 10 minutes**

1. Review your comparison table
2. Use **Prompt #5** to prioritize
3. Use **Prompt #6** to prepare talking points

---

## Prompt #5: Career Fair Strategy

<div style="font-size: 0.65em;">

```markdown
Based on the company comparison table, create my career fair 
action plan:

1. TOP PRIORITY (90+ match): Companies I MUST visit
   - Estimated time per company: 20-30 minutes
   - Best time to visit: [early/mid/late in fair]
   - Total time allocation

2. MEDIUM PRIORITY (70-89 match): Strong backup options
   - Time per company: 15-20 minutes
   - Visit if time permits

3. LOW PRIORITY (<70 match): Skip or very brief visit
   - Only if I have extra time

4. WILD CARDS: Companies slightly outside my current skillset 
   but with strong interest

Include a suggested schedule/route through the fair.
```

</div>

---

## Prompt #6: Conversation Prep

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">

```markdown
For [COMPANY NAME], create a 30-second elevator pitch I can use 
when approaching their booth. Include:

1. Strong opening hook (reference specific company need/value)
2. My relevant experience (2-3 key points from my persona)
3. Specific question about their role/opportunity
4. Confident closing

Make it conversational, authentic, and memorable. Avoid generic 
phrases like "I'm passionate about" or "I'm a hard worker."
```

</div>

## Real Example Walkthrough

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 1.5;">

**Scenario:** Computer Science student interested in web development

**Traditional Approach:**
- Waits 2 hours for Google booth
- Generic conversation: "I like coding, do you have internships?"
- Gives resume, gets business card
- Never hears back

**AI-Powered Approach:**
- Discovers mid-size company doing React/TypeScript work
- 15 minute wait
- Opens with: "I saw you're building customer portals in React—I just built a full-stack app for my university's student org with similar tech. Can we talk about your summer internship?"
- Recruiter is impressed, takes genuine interest
- Follow-up interview scheduled on the spot

</div>
